# Hyperion EMV Kernel Progress Log

This log records certification-hardening increments, evidence, and open risks.
It is intentionally concise: commit history remains the authoritative code
decision record, while this file tracks work toward certification readiness.

- Baseline checked: current public EMVCo materials still frame Level 2 as
  acceptance-device software compliance testing, with contact kernel approval
  requiring ICS submission, lab validation, test reports, and EMVCo approval.
- Increment completed: bound transaction amounts to explicit terminal currency
  exponent handling at the ABI boundary.
- Code impact: `KrnTxnParams` and `StoredTxnParams` now carry
  `currency_exponent`; the transaction data store emits EMV tag `5F36`; invalid
  exponents above single BCD digit range are rejected; ABI version increased to
  account for the struct layout change.
- Evidence updated: TLV catalogue now includes `5F36`, and KRN-API-003 RTM rows
  point to executable test evidence instead of pending implementation text.
- Verification: `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, and
  `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` passed.
- Remaining risk: this only closes a narrow API/currency-data gap. Final
  certification still requires licensed EMV/scheme reconciliation, lab-supplied
  vectors and profiles, recognized-lab execution, and approval artifacts.
